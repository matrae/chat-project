Display goal for difficulty (how many seconds should it take to generate a block, on average).

In MiningTask: Every X blocks, automatically adjust the difficulty level,
based on how long blocks have been taking to generate. Look at the timestamps,
calculate the actual time required, and adjust difficulty accordingly.
Careful: if mining was paused for lack of work, the timestamps will make
no sense for this purpose!

Only enable the mining "start" button if payloadpool is not empty
