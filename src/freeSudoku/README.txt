FreeSudoku is a GPL-licensed program whose home was once http://freesudoku.sourceforge.net/. It was no longer being maintains, so I forked it and made a number of improvements.

Before starting a game, you can set three options:

- Training mode allows FreeSudoku to give you hints.

- Symmetric games are mirror-symmetrical - this looks pretty, but is otherwise irrelevant

- Consistency checking helps prevents silly mistakes, like entering impossible numbers. Some regard this as cheating...

All options are off by default.

There are five difficulty levels. These are based on the complexity of the strategies required to solve the puzzle.

The numbered buttons highlight all existing entries of a particular digit. Click the same digit again to remove the highlighting.

FreeSudoku can be run in two ways, as a program or as an applet (see the corresponding main classes in the top level directory). As of this writing, both are available online:
